##  Overview  
This repository houses the **Final Project notebook**, showcasing the complete workflow from data cleaning and exploratory analysis to professional visualization using Python libraries. This project applies techniques learned throughout the course.

---

##  Project Highlights  
- **Data Cleaning** â€“ Handling missing data, formatting, and preparing datasets.  
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** â€“ Generating descriptive statistics to understand patterns.  
- **Data Visualization** â€“ Creating line charts, bar charts, scatter plots, pie charts, and histograms.  
- **Interpretation** â€“ Each visualization includes explanatory insights for stakeholders.

---

##  Visualizations Included  
- **Line Chart** â€“ Example: Population Growth Over Time  
- **Bar Chart** â€“ Example: GDP by Region  
- **Pie Chart** â€“ Example: Category Proportions  
- **Scatter Plot** â€“ Example: Reading Hours vs. Grades  
- **Histogram** â€“ Example: Distribution of Exam Scores  
- **Random Multi-Dimensional Scatter** â€“ Practice with colored and sized points

---

##  Requirements  
- **Python** 3.8+  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **Libraries**:
  ```bash
  pip install matplotlib numpy pandas
